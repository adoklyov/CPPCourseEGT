/*You are to implement an Alternative Vote system, a voting voting system used to select
one of a small number of candidates based on preferences expressed by voters.
1. Each voter ranks all of the candidates in order of preference.
2. If the majority of voters (i.e. more than half of them) have placed a particular candidate first, that candidate is selected and the procedure is complete.
3. Otherwise, the candidate with the least number of first preferences is removed from
consideration, the votes which placed that candidate first are distributed according
to their next preference, and the procedure continues at step 2.
For example, consider the following collection of votes for candidates 1, 2, 3 and 4:
4 2 3 1
2 3 4 1
4 2 1 3
4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
2 4 3
3 2
1 3 4 2
4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4
1 3 2 4
That is, the first voter prefers candidate 4, followed by candidate 2, and so on. Note
that voters need not list all candidates. You may assume that no vote contains the same
candidate twice.
1
Out of a total 12 votes, candidate 1 has 5 first preferences, candidate 2 has 2, candidate
3 has 1, and candidate 4 has 4. None of them has a majority, so the candidate with the
least first first preferences (candidate 3) is eliminated, so the votes become:
4 2 1
2 4 1
4 2 1
4 2 1
1 2 4
1 2
2 4
2
1 4 2
4 2 1
1 2 4
1 2 4
Now candidate 1 has 5 first preferences, candidate 2 has 3, and candidate 4 has 4. No
candidate has a majority yet, so now candidate 2 is eliminated, and the votes become:
4 1
4 1
4 1
4 1
1 4
1
4
1 4
4 1
1 4
1 4
There are now 11 votes, because one vote has had all its candidates eliminated. Now
candidate 4 has 6 votes, which is a majority, and is declared the winner.
In this case the process terminated with only two candidates, but in other cases one
candidate will achieve a majority earlier, and the process will then stop.
There is a possibility of a tie for the smallest number of votes, though this is rare with
large numbers of votes. If that happens, you are free to choose any of the tying candidates.*/
